The splash commpoent features a minimalistic and modern design to ensure a smooth user experience.

**Background:**

A clean, neutral background color (e.g., white, near black) creates a calming first impression.

**Central Element:**

At the center, a stylized flag logo is prominently displayed. The flag design incorporates modern vector aesthetics, ensuring it scales well for different devices. The logo can include a subtle animation, such as a gentle waving motion or a fade-in effect, to add life to the splash screen.

**Loading Indicator:**

Below the flag logo, a sleek loading spinner or progress bar is included, designed in harmony with the app's theme colors. This indicator ensures users know the app is actively loading.

**Brand Name or Tagline:**

Optionally, you can include the app's name or tagline under the flag logo, using a typeface that aligns with your brand's identity.

> The entire splash screen design prioritizes loading times and transitions smoothly to the main UI—ensuring a polished user experience.
