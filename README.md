- **React**: The portfolio is built using React, a JavaScript library for creating interactive UIs. React helps in building a dynamic and responsive user experience.
- **Figma**: All design work showcased in this portfolio was created using Figma, a collaborative design tool that allows for crafting detailed designs and prototypes.
- **Storybook**: Storybook is used for developing and documenting UI components in isolation. It allows for creating and testing individual components outside of the main application, ensuring they work as expected and facilitating better UI development.
- **Vercel**: The portfolio is hosted on Vercel, which provides fast, reliable, and scalable hosting. Vercel enables continuous deployment and serverless functions, ensuring optimal performance and availability.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
